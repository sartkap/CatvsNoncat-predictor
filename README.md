# Cat-vs-Noncat-predictor
We solve a two class classification problem using logistic regression. The model can be tested on any dataset the user wants. \
The **catvsnoncat_full_analysis** contains the analysis of how the algorithm has performed on the current dataset and hyperparameter tuning. It uses different values of learning rate and compares the reduction in cost function that results from each of them by plotting a graph.\
The **code(log_reg).py** file contains the code to classify images as cat or non-cat. Here specify the name of your image in line 104 of the code and path to the image in line 105.
